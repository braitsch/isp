## [Is My Internet Online?](http://isp.braitsch.io/)

#### Quickly find out if your area has lost service without the bother of calling your ISP.

This is an archival project from back in time when ISPs did not provide system status alerts when they were experiencing an outage. [Comcast/Xfinity](https://www.xfinity.com/support/status/) along with many other major IPSs now provide this service.

You know how frustrating it is when your internet suddenly stops working and you have no idea why? Sadly **none** of the major US broadband providers offer an online status indicator to quickly let you know if they're experiencing an outage.

Now you can, via your mobile, quickly check to see if others around you have also been bumped offline â€“ negating the need to contact your ISP yourself to find out what's going on.
